        />The main characters; Gon Freecs, Killua Zoldyck, Leorio Paradinight,
        Kurapika (either Yukino or Kurta), and arguably Hisoka Morrow each have
        interesting personalities and characteristics. If we're going by tropes,
        Leorio is the every-man, Hisoka is the wild card, Kurapika is the hero,
        Killua is Gon's care-giver, and Gon is the explorer. normally, this
        would be fairly standard, but most of the story doesn't follow Kurapika
        as the protagonist, but Gon
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Gon Freecs</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="portrait" src="images/gon.png" alt="" /> Gon is the main
        protagonist of the story. He's a 12 year old son of a hunter, who grew
        up on Wale Island; a fairly large provincial island with a decently
        sized forest. His goal is to find his estranged father, and to achieve
        that goal, he, at the age of 12, follows in his father's footsteps and
        applies for one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. In the hunter
        exam that year alone, 39 people are shown being killed and many more
        deaths are implied. Gon's morality is directly tied to his curiosity and
        friendships. He sees no problem with killua being an assassin, but can't
        forgive Neferpitou for being unable to bring his mentor back to life.
        he's also stubborn to the point of extreme bodily injury and driven for
        self improvement
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Killua Zoldyck</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="portrait" src="images/killua.png" alt="" /> Killua is the
        3rd son of the world famous assassins, the Zoldyck family. He was
        conditioned from a young age to live up to the family legacy and become
        a efficient killing machine. He initially took the hunter exam as a
        combination of rebellion and entertainment, but soon made his first
        friend in Gon. Killua almost grows to revere Gon, because of his own
        complete lack of friends his entire life up until that point, and Gon's
        (usually) upbeat, cheerful personality. Killua's struggle throughout
        most of the series is his belief that he doesn't deserve Gon as a
        friend, as well as a mental block against fighting opponents he isn't
        certain he can win against (put into his head by his brother Illumi).
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Leorio Paradinight</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="portrait" src="images/leorio.png" />Leorio is the most human
        of the main characters. He grew up in a slum and saw first hand that
        those without money can't gurantee their wellbeing. His ambition for
        joining the hunter association is quite simply, to get filthy rich,
        because as he said,
        <i
          >"For the right price, one can buy not only treasures, but dreams,
          hearts, <b>and even people's lives!!</b>. . . If I had the money, my
          friend wouldn't have died."</i
        >
        Leorio is there to remind you that normal people exist, and more
        importantly, deserve to exist
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Kurapika Kurta</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="portrait" src="images/Kurapika.png" />Kurapika is the last
        survivor of the Kurta clan, an insular community who's eyes turn a
        beautiful red when they experience strong emotion, and his ultimate goal
        is to take revenge on his clan and recover their stolen eyes. this may
        sound like a certain lightning-wielding edgelord, but Sasuke is based
        off of
        <a href="https://yuyuhakusho.fandom.com/wiki/Hiei" target="_blank"
          >Hiei from YuYu Hakusho</a
        >, and almost certainly Kurapika as well. outside of his goal, Kurapika
        is a kind and caring person, and he doesn't even like fighing when it's
        his mortal enemies, a group of bandits called the phantom troup
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Hisoka Morrow</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="portrait" src="images/hisoka.png" />Hisoka is less of a
        protagonist or antagonist, and more of a wild beast. He does whatever he
        wants in order to satisfy his desires, and it just so happens that he
        gets sexual pleasure from fighting (and usually killing) strong
        opponents. yes, it is as unsettling as it seems. you aren't supposed to
        like Hisoka, but you aren't really supposed to hate him, either. He's
        fickle like the weather and all that he can be relied upon to do is
        cause chaos. his goals happen to allign with the others' fairly often
        and he has the same protagonist marker (the month and day of his
        birthday share the same number), but officially, he's not one of the
        protagonists

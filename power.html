      <div id="hr"></div>
      <p>
        <img id="display1" src="images/nenhex.jpg" />Nen is the power system of
        Hunter x Hunter. there are multiple levels of understanding to nen, but
        in a general sense, it's an energy tied to ones life force and
        personality, which they can use to achieve superhuman feats. in the
        world of Hunter x Hunter, all occurrences that are seen as supernatural,
        as well as most acts of genius, are caused by some application of nen.
        One of the requirements, as well as the only hidden requirement, to
        being a pro hunter is proficiency in nen. Its existence is kept a secret
        from general society due to the chaos superhuman criminals would cause
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">basics</h2>
      <p>
        use of nen is the application of a life force that flows through all
        creatures. there are 2 known ways to develop nen. one can either survive
        an attack infused with nen (called initiation, or babtism), and have
        their 'aura nodes' forcefully opened, or they can spend a great deal of
        time painstakingly training to consciously open and close said nodes.
        While initiation is significantly faster and easier, the risks involved
        mean that hardly anyone opts for this method. Should the teacher not be
        skilled enough, or the student talented enough, initiation can very
        easily lead to death or debilitating injury. Nen is not only tied to
        one's life force, but also their mental state (this will be important
        when we discuss nen types, conditions, and post-mortem nen)
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">The 4 major principles & advanced techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <h4>4 major principles</h4>
        <li id="ten">
          Ten <sub><i>envelop/shroud</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          Ten is the rest state of a nen user. a state of ten prevents the life
          force that would normally leak off of an individual from escaping, and
          instead, envelops them in a shroud that feels a bit like lukewarm
          water. This helps defend against aging, emotional nen attacks, and
          some degree of physical attack
        </p>
        <li id="zetsu">
          Zetsu <sub><i>supress/null</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          zetsu is the complete cessation of external nen flow. this has the
          benefit of enhanced recovery from fatigue, better nen sensitivity
          which makes it easier to track nen users, and the weakening or
          outright elimination of one's presence. The negative to this technique
          is that, while you are in zetsu, you're as vulnerable to nen as a
          normal person
        </p>
        <li id="ren">
          Ren <sub><i>refine/enhance</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          ren is the opposite of zetsu, where instead of internalizing all your
          aura, you output much more than your body's baseline. this is the
          power-up application. A strong ren means a strong fighter, and it's
          the nen equivalent to strenuous aerobic exercise
        </p>
        <li>
          Hatsu <sub><i>release/act</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          Hatsu is one's personal expression of nen. It is also the most
          complicated aspect of nen, and will be explained further
          <a href="#nentype">here</a>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h4>Advanced techniques</h4>
      <p>
        The advanced techniques are, as the name implies, advanced applications
        of the 4 major principles
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li id="gyo">
          Gyo <sub><i>focus</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          gyo is an application of <a href="#ren">ren</a> where one focuses a
          larger portion of the aura to one part of their body, strengthening it
          but weakening the defenses elsewhere. Gyo's most common application is
          strengthening the eyes so one can see aura hidden via in
        </p>
        <li>
          In <sub><i>conceal</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          in is an advanced form of <a href="#zetsu">zetsu</a>, which hides the
          aura from observation, rather than stop the flow outright
        </p>
        <li>
          En <sub><i>circle</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          An advanced application of <a href="#ten">ten</a> and
          <a href="#ren">ren</a>, en acts sort of like a sphere which can be
          used to detect nen users, even ones using zetsu. En is extremely
          tiring, however, and isn't usually suitable for extended use
        </p>
        <li>
          Shu <sub><i>enfold</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          shu is an application of <a href="#ten">ten</a>, where a user extends
          their aura to cover an object, strengthening it and allowing them to
          use it as an extension of their body
        </p>
        <li>
          Ko <sub><i>temper</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          a combination of <a href="#ten">ten</a>, <a href="#zetsu">zetsu</a>,
          <a href="#hatsu">hatsu</a>, <a href="#ren">ren</a>, and
          <a href="#gyo">gyo</a>, where a user concentrates all their aura into
          a single point to make one extremely powerful attack, at the cost of
          forgoing any sort of defense.
        </p>
        <li id="ken">
          Ken <sub><i>fortify</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          a combination of <a href="#ren">ren</a> and <a href="#ten">ten</a>,
          ken is an armor created by making a (usually 10x) larger ten
        </p>
        <li>
          Ryu <sub><i>flow</i></sub>
        </li>
        <p>
          Ryu is a combination of <a href="#gyo">gyo</a> and
          <a href="#ken">ken</a> that allows for real-time adjustments between
          offense and defense. if used improperly, ryu could cause injury which
          could have been prevented with ken, or stereograph your attacks,
          allowing for easy counter-attacks
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="nentype" class="title">Nen Abilities</h1>
      <p>
        all Nen abilities fall into a combination of 6 nen types, and your
        affinity with the types dictates how difficult it will be to learn their
        techniques
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#transmuter">transmuter</a></li>
        <li><a href="#conjurer">conjurer</a></li>
        <li><a href="#enhancer">enhancer</a></li>
        <li><a href="#emitter">emitter</a></li>
        <li><a href="#manipulator">manipulator</a></li>
        <li><a href="#specialist">specialist</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        you can determine what your nen type is through either of 2 techniques.
        water divination is the commonly accepted method. to conduct water
        divination, get a glass of water, float a leaf on the water, and funnel
        your aura into the glass
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>transmuters change the taste of the water</li>
        <li>conjurers conjure impurities in the water</li>
        <li>enhancers hange the volume of the water</li>
        <li>emitters change the color of the water</li>
        <li>manipulators move the leaf floating in the water</li>
        <li>
          specialist abilities are unpredictable, so if some other change
          happens, you're a specialist
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>there's also Hisoka Morrow's personality test</p>
      <ul>
        <li>transmuters are whimsical, fickle, and prone to deciet</li>
        <li>
          conjurers are typically high strung or overly serious, stoic, and
          nervous
        </li>
        <li>enhancers are simple and determined</li>
        <li>emitters are impatient,impulsive, and short-tempered</li>
        <li>manipulators are argumentative and logical</li>
        <li>specialists are independent and charismatic</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="transmuter">Transmuters</h4>
      <p>
        transmuter abilities involve changing your aura into a different forms,
        such as Lightning, thread, fire, or Bungee Gum. notable transmuters are
        Hisoka, feitan, Machi, Killua, and Biscuit
      </p>
      <h4 id="conjurer">Conjurers</h4>
      <p>
        Conjurer abilities focus on creating objects from one's aura. these
        objects can be anything you can imagine, but you have to imagine all of
        their traits. To make his signature chains, Kurapika had to observe
        chains with all 5 senses until he started dreaming of chains
